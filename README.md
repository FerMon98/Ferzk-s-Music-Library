## Database (tables used)

- `songs`  
  `song_id` (PK), `title`, `artist`, `album`, `album_cover` (URL),  
  `genre`, `duration`, `lyrics`, `lyrics_source_url`, `link` (YouTube), `file_path` (mp3 path, optional)

- `users`  
  `id_user` (PK), `name`, `last_name`, `username`, `email`, `password` (bcrypt), `phone_number`

- `user_playlists`  
  `user_id`, `song_id` (composite PK) ‚Äì links users to songs

- `contact`  
  `username`, `email`, `message`, `created_at`

- `forum_posts` / `forum_comments`  
  Minimal schema to support post + comment streams

- `uploaded_files` *(optional)*  
  Basic storage for uploaded assets

> If `lyrics_source_url` doesn‚Äôt exist, the app works without it; add later via:
> ```sql
> ALTER TABLE songs ADD COLUMN lyrics_source_url VARCHAR(255) NULL AFTER lyrics;
> ```

## Local Development

### 1) MySQL
Create the database and a user (or use `root` locally):

```sql
CREATE DATABASE ferzk_music_library CHARACTER SET utf8mb4 COLLATE utf8mb4_unicode_ci;

### 2) Configure PHP

Edit /php_setup_files/connection.php with your local credentials:
$servername = "localhost";
$username   = "root";
$password   = "";
$dbname     = "ferzk_music_library";

### 3) Start a PHP dev server

From the project root:
php -S 127.0.0.1:8000

Open http://127.0.0.1:8000/index.php
Tip: Don‚Äôt use VS Code ‚ÄúLive Server‚Äù for PHP ‚Äî it doesn‚Äôt execute PHP.

### 4) Seed some songs

Use Webpages/formadd-remove.php to add songs with YouTube links.

Covers will auto-derive from YouTube if album_cover is empty.

Paste lyrics via Webpages/add-lyrics.php (requires login).

Notable Implementation Details

Cover fallback:
Extracts YouTube video id from songs.link and uses
https://img.youtube.com/vi/<id>/maxresdefault.jpg with a local
placeholder fallback.

Auth redirects:
When a protected page is accessed while logged out, users are sent to
/php_setup_files/login.php?return=<original-url> and redirected back
after login.

No autoplay:
The user playlist page initializes quietly; playback only begins after a
user click.

Roadmap

Richer playlists (mood/tags)

Search & filters

Role-based moderation for lyrics/forum

Optional media storage (S3/Cloudinary) for artwork and audio
